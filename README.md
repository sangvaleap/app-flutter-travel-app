# Travel App - Flutter

The project aims to provide a platform for users who are in search of tours and travel-related information. Travel agencies can use the system to post and market their tour packages and services, allowing them to reach a wider range of customers while app users find it easier, safer, and more convenient for them to search and inquire about their favorite destinations, and to book tour packages. The application will make travel bookings easy, fast, convenient, and efficient.

By this version, features include:
- List of Countries: this module allows users of the application to view a list of countries as travel destinations. 
- Destination's Description: this module provides additional information about the place, such as the exact location, ratings, and tour package.
- Notification: this module will notify customers about their transactions in the app as well as the status of their travel inquiries.
- Settings Page: this module allows  users to manage the settings of their account in the application such as notifications, bookings, privacy and security, and theme.
